# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description

My motivation for this project was implement all of knowledge using third-party API's as well as jQurey and day.js that we learned throughtout the current week. As well as how it all ties into the previous weeks using html,css, and javascript.
The reason for building this project was that I wanted to create a working website that could be fully interactive as well as be functional for any current user. This was an important tool to learn as well as use due to the fact that it will be used alot in day to day usage for any future employer. 

The problem that was solved creating this application is that it is a full work day calendar that any user can use to store their schedule on a day to day basis. 

Throughout building this application I learned to implement my new knowledge of third-party API's that inlcude jQurey and day.js. This will help me grow as a fullstack developer!
